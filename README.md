# Electronics Dictionary Summary

This is my second milestone project where I have designed, designed and developed a web app with the use of Frontend and Backend technologies. 
My goals with this web app is to teach people all about the terminology behind electronics.
I have taken my knowledge learned from the Full Stack Software Developer course, 
(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Bootstrap, MongoDB) to provide a clear,
 functioning and responsive web application that 
demonstrates a proficient use of HTML5, Python and MongoDB, with slight uses of CSS3 and JavaScript. 
The Bootstrap Framework was used along side
these programming languages to help give
the site a clear strucutre and ensure the site has a high standard of responsiveness on desktop, tablet and
mobile devices.

*Electronics Dictionary* is a project for a web application to help people who might not understand the terminology 
behind electronics.
Be it , computers , phones, screens etc. The app acts as a dictionary to help teach others about electronics and 
technology as a whole, which is where the majority of my passion is.

The full site is deployed to Heroku, and you can visit it [here](https://electronics-dictionary.herokuapp.com/).

## User Stories

* User Goals:
    * As a user, I want to be able to navigate through the entire site, comfortably and securely.
    * As a user, I want to have the ability to create an account.
    * As a user, I want to be able to create my own dictionary item and add it to the web app.
    * As a user, I want to be able to edit or delete my added dictionary item.
    * As a user, I want to have a page dedicated to my account.
    * As a user, I want to be able to navigate to the developers LinkedIn and GitHub accounts.


* For the user, the site assists in meeting the user goals by:
    * Presenting a clean website that's easy-on-the-eye, providing smooth navigation with the use of a fixed navbar.
    This enables them to click between the pages at all times. The user can also click on the logo from
    any page to take them back to the home page.
    * Providing a clean, basic form that doesn't overwhelm or confuse the user which they can fill out to submit their own dictionary item to the web app.
    * The user can add their own account which enable them to create their own dictionary items and also allows them to edit and delete said items.
    * The user can easily log in/out of their profile and navigate to the developers social links.
