# Electronics Dictionary Summary

This is my third milestone project out of 4 in the Code Institute Full Stack Developer course
where I have designed and developed a web app with the use of Frontend and Backend technologies. 
My goals with this web app is to teach people all about the terminology behind electronics.
I have taken my knowledge learned from the Full Stack Software Developer course, 
(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Bootstrap, MongoDB) to provide a clear,
functioning and responsive web application that 
demonstrates a proficient use of HTML5, Python and MongoDB, with slight uses of CSS3 and JavaScript. 
The Bootstrap Framework was used along side
these programming languages to help give
the site a clear strucutre and ensure the site has a high standard of responsiveness on desktop, tablet and
mobile devices.

*Electronics Dictionary* is a project for a web application to help people who might not understand the terminology 
behind electronics.
Be it , computers , phones, screens etc. The app acts as a dictionary to help teach others about electronics and 
technology as a whole, which is where the majority of my passion is.

The full site is deployed to Heroku, and you can visit it [here](https://electronics-dictionary.herokuapp.com/).
